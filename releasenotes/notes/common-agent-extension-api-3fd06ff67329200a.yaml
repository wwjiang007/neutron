    L2 agents based on ``ML2`` ``_common_agent`` have now the L2 extension API
    available. This API can be used by L2 extension drivers to request
    resources from the L2 agent.
    It is used, for example, to pass an instance of the ``IptablesManager``
    to the ``Linuxbridge`` L2 agent ``QoS extension driver``.
