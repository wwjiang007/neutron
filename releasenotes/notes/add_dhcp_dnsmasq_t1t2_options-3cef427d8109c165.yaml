    Allow configuration of DHCP renewal (T1) and rebinding (T2) timers in
    ``neutron-dhcp-agent``. By allowing these timers to be set (options 58
    and 59 as per RFC2132) in ``dnsmasq`` it allows users to change
    other parameters, like MTU, on instances without having to wait for
    the lease time to expire. The advantage of changing T1 over the
    lease time is that if the DHCP server becomes unreachable within
    the lease time, instances will not drop their IP addresses and it
    will not cause a dataplane disruption.
