    Neutron agents now support SSL connections to OVSDB server.
    To enable an SSL based connection, use an ``ssl`` prefixed URI for the
    ``ovsdb_connection`` setting.  When using SSL it is also required to set
    new ``ovs`` group options which include ``ssl_key_file``, ``ssl_cert_file``, and
    ``ssl_ca_cert_file``.
