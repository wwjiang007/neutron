prelude: >
    In order to reduce the time spent processing security group updates in
    the L2 agent, conntrack deletion is now performed in a set of worker
    threads instead of the main agent thread, so it can return to processing
    other events quickly.

    On an upgrade, conntrack entries will now be cleaned-up in a worker
    thread, instead of in the calling thread.
